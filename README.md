[Check out my repo about my python-made search engine](https://github.com/amedeo463/python-search-engine)!\
Or perhaps [see my chaotic virus](https://github.com/amedeo463/Tab-d)?\
I even have an italian translation of SMB at [this link](https://github.com/amedeo463/supermariobrositalian),\
and a stress tester at [this link](https://github.com/amedeo463/stressTester)! (No It's not)

<s>Also, I've created [PinsaScript and PScrInt](https://github.com/amedeo463/PScrInt).</s><br>Nevermind I deprecated that one, check [PinScreen](https://github.com/amedeo463/PinScreen) instead.
